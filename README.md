# Koopman-identification
Main and dual identification methods in the Koopman operator framework.

Main functions:
- lifting_ident_main (main method)
- lifting_ident_dual (dual method)

Examples:
- Lorenz system (main method)
- Duffing system (main method with input)
- Toggle swicth system (main method with non polynomial vector field)
- Nonlinear networked system (dual method)
